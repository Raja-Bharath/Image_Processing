# Image_Processing
Welcome to the world of Image Processing Basics! This repository serves as an introductory guide and playground for anyone stepping into the fascinating realm of image manipulation, analysis, and transformation using Python.

## File Descriptions

### Image_Loading_Displaying.py
- Basic script to load and display images using OpenCV and other image processing libraries.

### Image_Transformation.py
- Includes techniques for image transformation, such as resizing, rotating, and flipping images.
  
### Blur.py
- Script demonstrating various techniques for blurring images using filters like Gaussian blur and average blur.

### Color_Channels.py
- Illustrates working with different color channels in images, exploring RGB, HSV, and other color representations.

### Drawing.py
- Contains code for drawing shapes, lines, and text on images using OpenCV.

### Edge_Detection.py
- Covers methods for detecting edges and contours in images using algorithms like Canny edge detection.

### Histogram.py
- Demonstrates how to analyze and plot histograms for image distributions, showcasing pixel intensity distributions.



### Masking.py
- Covers image masking techniques, including applying masks to isolate specific areas of an image.

### Pixel_Manipulation.py
- Script showcasing pixel-level manipulation, such as changing pixel values or colors in images.

## Getting Started

Each script serves as a standalone example. You can run these scripts individually to understand and experiment with various image-processing concepts.

Feel free to explore these scripts and modify them to suit your image processing needs!

Happy Processing! üåüüñºÔ∏è
